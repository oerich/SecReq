Payment for a transaction is only required when a detail transaction is submitted for payment, A merchant acquirer may choose to pay the merchant using the batch total;nonsec
The timing of payment to the merchant must be established between the merchant and the merchant acquirer;nonsec
A purchase transaction may be reversed, prior to the removal of the CEP card from the POS device, by sending a purchase reversal command to the CEP card, The CEP card must authenticate the PSAM using certificates previously exchanged;sec
The amount to be reversed is the amount of the last step of the transaction. The reversal command sent to the CEP card contains a S2 MAC computed by the PSAM;sec

The CEP card authenticates the PSAM using the certificates previously received and the S2, The CEP card increments the value of the purse and logs the transaction;sec
The CEP card sends a response to the reversal command to the POS device. The reversal is considered to be successful even in the event of a negative response or no response from the CEP card;nonsec
After the CEP card is inserted in the POS device, the POS device initiates the cancel last purchase transaction;nonsec
If the POS device supports multiple applications or multiple transaction types, an interaction between the terminal and consumer or sales agent determines the CEP application and the function to be performed (cancel last purchase transaction);nonsec
The CEP card verifies that the PSAM is the PSAM used in the original transaction, computes a S1 MAC using the same DES session key that was used for the purchase transaction being cancelled, and responds to the POS device with the S1 and the identification of the last transaction. If the purchase transaction to be canceled has been canceled or is not part of the active batch, the command is not allowed;sec

Payment decisions are based on signature validations, scheme provider rules, and merchant and merchant acquirer agreements;sec
After investigation, if the merchant acquirer decides, based on scheme rules, to accept the transactions, a method must exist to settle them and forward them to the card issuer;nonsec
A transaction that passes merchant acquirer validations and is forwarded to the card issuer is paid for by the card issuer. If the transaction does not pass card issuer validations, the card issuer may follow the scheme providerÉ??s dispute procedures;nonsec
Pay on detail is the default payment arrangement for merchant acquirers to provide payment to their merchants. In this arrangement, the merchant acquirer relies on the POS transaction S5 MAC to determine acceptance. Merchants are paid only for valid POS transactions;sec
POS transactions that were rejected for payment by the merchant acquirer are flagged with an error code indicating the type of validation failure and are forwarded to the card issuer for CEP card history information only;nonsec
All load transactions are on-line transactions. Authorization of funds for load transactions must require a form of cardholder verification. The load device must support on-line encrypted PIN or off-line PIN verification;sec
Off-line PIN verification must include both encrypted and unencrypted PIN;sec
The card verification method indicator (CVMI) in the CEP card must specify support of online PIN verification and at least one method of off-line PIN verification (encrypted or unencrypted);sec

As a result, the design specification must not preclude dual-leg transactions** from taking place either sequentially or in parallel. The design of a given implementation will vary depending on the device, host, and network capabilities;nonsec
Unload and currency exchange transactions are optional for CEP card issuers. The CEP card must indicate whether the card issuer supports these transactions. However, if a card issuer issues multi-currency capable cards, it must provide its cardholder with a facility to remove any remaining value. As a result, if a card issuer supports loading of multiple currencies onto a card, then it must support the unload or currency exchange transaction or both;nonsec
The card issuer must establish its policies for assigning and adjusting slot maximum balances. These policies may require the card issuer to maintain a card database;nonsec
Currency exchange rate fluctuations may increase the card issuers liability. The card issuer must be able to adjust maximum balances to bring them in line with their policies.

The CEP card may support multiple currencies. Each currency occupies a É??slotÉ?ù within the CEP. The slots are defined by the currency supported. The currency for an individual slot is determined during load or currency exchange. Currency exchange could apply to a single slot, and then only for the total balance;nonsec
It is a card issuerÉ??s decision to determine the currencies that are allowed to occupy slots in the CEP card. This decision is made by the card issuer during the load or currency exchange transaction, by approving or rejecting the request to authorize the transaction;nonsec
A single currency cannot occupy more than one slot. The CEP card must not permit a slot to be assigned a currency if another slot in the CEP card has already been assigned to that currency;nonsec
The CEP card limits each slot to a maximum balance. The maximum balance for a slot is established when a currency is assigned to the slot, and is determined externally by the card issuer or by CEP card data which indicates a maximum balance in a reference currency. There is no requirement that all slot maximums have the same relative value, and there is no requirement for the card to maintain a maximum total value;nonsec
Only one version of the CA public key is required in the card. This requires that the PSAMs with which the CEP card exchanges cryptograms must be capable of generating and validating cryptograms using the relevant keys from all current cards;sec
Two-way, or mutual, authentication, where the card authenticates the terminal and the terminal authenticates the card for each transaction, must be performed for off-line transactions;sec
For increased security and convenience, asymmetric cryptography must be used as the authentication security for off-line transactions;sec

Load and unload functions must be authenticated using end-to-end security between the card and the card issuer;sec
The issuer host must authenticate the card upon the load/unload request;sec
The card must authenticate the issuer host upon the response to the request;sec
A proof must be sent to the load acquirer that a load or unload occurred to avoid repudiation;sec
The management of keys must be accomplished in a secure, certified environment;sec
There may be multiple certification authorities that manage keys for the system, including the possibility of one overall highest level certification authority (perhaps on an international level), and domestic certification authorities for each country or region;sec
The system must protect the integrity of key transaction data including transaction identification, currency code and amount. If tampering is suspected, the system must cause the transaction to fail;sec

The time period during which a cardholder can unload electronic value, perform a purchase or a currency exchange from an expired card may be determined by each issuer;nonsec
Consumers must be able to load electronic value to their cards at any participating load device, regardless of the location, provided that the currency that is requested is supported by the acquirer and the card issuer;nonsec
Funds issuers must accept funds authorization requests, regardless of the load currency type, as permitted;sec
Load devices that are available to the general public should support multiple sources of funding and support both linked and unlinked loads;nonsec
Authorizations for load transactions require a form of cardholder authentication for funds requests;sec
The load device must support on-line PIN encryption or off-line PIN verification;sec
The load device which supports only off-line PIN verification must support both the off-line PIN encryption method and the off-line PIN plain text verification method as defined in EMV;sec
Unload transactions do not require cardholder authentication. (However, an acquirerÉ??s devices may be configured such that authentication is required for access.);sec
The architecture for the electronic purse should not preclude the eventual deployment of a variety of devices to meet the needs of many card acceptance environments. Unload must not be precluded from being supported on any or all of these devices at the option of the acquirer;nonsec
